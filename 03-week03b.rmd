# Week 3 Practical Alternate: Using AGOL for Crime Mapping {-}

**Content coming Wednesday 27th Jan**

<!-- AGO uses WGS84/Mercator as default and can only be altered if you change the basemap to a dataset that is in your desired CRS/PS (although in their Beta version, it appears that there will be more user choice over choosing projections). When using traditional GIS software, CRS and projections can cause substantial issues, particularly if there is a mismatch across your datasets. Whilst QGIS and ArcPro has the ability to “reproject” your data to the project CRS “on the fly” (i.e. without you having to do anything), within ArcMap and R-Studio, you will need to reproject your dataset to match either your other datasets or overall project CRS yourself. Often you can see a visual mismatch in the data loaded (see below), but at other times, you might not notice that you are using datasets with different CRSs/projections. With AGO, you should only use data provided in the WGS84 CRS to ensure you have no do not have a mismatch when visualising your data on the map. We’ll talk more about projections in the lecture and practical! -->
