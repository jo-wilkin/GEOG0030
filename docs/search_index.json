Over the next ten weeks, you’ll learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis whilst implementing small research projects, first using Q-GIS, and then using the R programming language within R-Studio. You’ll learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socio-economic datasets, and then analyse them using core spatial and statistical analysis techniques. The course is an excellent precursor for those of you interested in a career in (spatial) data science! The course will consist of approximately 10 lectures, 10 self-led practicals and 5 seminars (held online), further details of which are provided on the next page, Course Information. For now, if you’ve not watched the Introduction video on Moodle, you can catch up below: Geocomputation Introductory Video Remember you must have joined our Geocomputation Team on Microsoft Teams to be able to watch our lecture videos - instructions are provided on Moodle. Using this Handbook All course content, including lectures and practical material, will be contained within this Handbook. As outlined above, you will also need to be part of our Geocomputation Team to have access to the lectures within the handbook. Each week’s content will be uploaded for Tuesday 10am UK time after the third seminar or coding help sessions. Key things to look out for in the handbook are Assignments, which are short optional submissions, Practical Instructions, Key Readings and Points of Information. To help, we’ll highlight as follows: Reading The recommended readings for this week will be highlighted in a Reading box as and when appropriate in the week’s content. You’ll be able to find direct links to them within the E-Reading list provided here. Getting in touch during the module The module is convened and taught by Dr Joanna Wilkin - you can contact her at j.wilkin [at] ucl.ac.uk or, for online office hours, you can book a half hour slot using MS Bookings. The module is further supported by two Postgraduate Teaching Assistants: Jakub (Kuba) Wyszomierski and Nikki Tang. Noticed a mistake in this resource?

"],["course-information.html", "Course information Module structure Weekly topics Learning objectives Reading list Module assessment details Useful additional resources", " Course information Module structure This module consists of ten self-led workshops, ten interactive seminar discussions and ten help sessions. Each week, we’ll provide an online workshop, provided as a worksheet with videos and instructions to complete the practical component of the workshop. All online classes will be held on the Principles of Spatial Analysis ‘team’. In addition, each week will have its own reading list or additional ‘recommended’ (optional, not required!) online tutorials we know of that you might want to also complete. Weekly topics Week Date Topic 1 05/10/2020 Spatial analysis for data science 2 12/10/2020 Representation, scale and geography in spatial analysis 3 19/10/2020 Spatial properties, relationships and operations 4 26/10/2020 Spatial dependence, spatial autocorrelation and defining neighbours 5 02/11/2020 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis reading week reading week reading week 6 16/11/2020 Point pattern analysis 7 23/11/2020 Raster data and geostatistics 8 30/11/2020 Spatial analysis for urban (mapping) applications 9 07/12/2020 Geodemographics 10 14/12/2020 Reproducible research Learning objectives By the end of the module, you should: have a good understanding of the principles underlying the analysis of spatial data in general and spatial statistics in particular; be able to use GIS software and tools for generating and visualising summary statistics; be able to examine, analyse and simulate a range of spatial patterns and processes; be able to use geostatistical tools to analyze and interpolate spatial patterns; appreciate the many different sources of uncertainty in spatial data and spatial processing and how to address such issues in analysis and research; be able to master the key concepts in network analysis with a focus on social and spatial networks (now in Intro to Data Science and Advanced Data Science modules); be able to explain several novel applications of spatial analysis techniques within geographic and social data science applications. Reading list We link to books and resources throughout each practical. The full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course. Alternatively, you can always easily find the link to the Reading List in the top right of any Moodle page for our module, under “Library Resources”. This Reading List will be updated on a weekly basis, in preparation for the week to come, so you may see some weeks without reading for now. But please check back at the start of each week as the lecture, seminar and/or workshop material is released for that week to check for new readings. All reading for that week will be provided by the time your learning materials are released - so you will not need to check the reading list for updates as the week progresses. Module assessment details The assessment for Principles of Spatial Analysis is set across two pieces of separate coursework, weighted at 50% each. The first piece of coursework will involve the completion of a spatial analysis project, based on the theory, concepts and application learnt during the module. A 1,500 word report will be submitted, alongside the code used within the project, which describes the analysis undertaken and the results of the analysis. Further guidance is available on Moodle. The second piece of coursework will be a written (1,500 word) review on a current data science application that uses spatial analysis as its core methodology. The application can be drawn from the lecture material, particularly during Weeks 8 and 9, or one of your own choice. Further guidance us available on Moodle. Useful additional resources Besides the mandatory and recommended reading for this course, there are some additional resources that are worth checking out: MIT’s introduction course on mastering the command line: The Missing Semester of Your CS Education A useful tool to unpack command line instructions: explainshell.com Online resource to develop and check your regular expressions: regexr.com Selecting colour palettes for your map making and data visualisation: colorbrewer 2.0 "]]
