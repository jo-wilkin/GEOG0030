[["index.html", "Geocomputation 2020-2021 Work Book Module Introduction Learning Objectives", " Geocomputation 2020-2021 Work Book Module Introduction Welcome to this year’s Geocomputation module, a course that introduces you to both the principles of spatial analysis and the use of programming for data analysis. Over the next ten weeks, you’ll learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis whilst implementing small research projects, first using Q-GIS, and then using the R programming language within the R-Studio software environment. You’ll learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socio-economic datasets, and then analyse them using core spatial and statistical analysis techniques. The course is an excellent precursor for those of you interested in a career in (spatial) data science! The course will consist of approximately 10 lectures, 10 self-led practicals, 5 seminars (held online) and 5 coding help sessions (held online), further details of which are provided on the next page, Module Information. For now, if you’ve not watched the Introduction video on Moodle, you can catch up below: Geocomputation Introductory Video Remember you must have joined our Geocomputation Team on Microsoft Teams to be able to watch our lecture videos - instructions are provided on Moodle. Learning Objectives As you’ll have read in the Module Catalogue entry, the main learning objectives for the module are as follows: Understand the ways in which digital representations of the observable world are created, and how representations of neighbourhood communities are built from publicly available Open Data. Gain practical experience of the use of analytical methods to profile small areas of London. Understand the nature of geographic data, and the concepts of spatial autocorrelation, modifiable areal units and neighbourhood classification. Understand the sources and operation of uncertainties in the creation of geographic representations, and the importance of generalisation, abstraction and metadata. Gain practical experience of software, map design and visual communication. Develop practical skills in data acquisition and analytics, which may be useful in the planning of dissertations. We hope that you’ll learn many other things during the module and it inspires you to think about how you might use spatial analysis, GIS and programming in your future career! Getting in touch during the module The module is convened and taught by Dr Joanna Wilkin - you can contact her at j.wilkin [at] ucl.ac.uk or, for online office hours, you can book a half hour slot using MS Bookings. The module is further supported by two Postgraduate Teaching Assistants: Jakub (Kuba) Wyszomierski and Nikki Tanu. They will host coding help sessions on the alternative weeks to our scheduled seminar sessions. Acknowledgements Putting together a workbook such as this is no easy feat - but it’s also something that after a little time with R-Studio, you’d be able to produce! The reason for this, as we’ll repeat throughout the course, is that there is an incredible amount of resources available online that can help you learn the skills required to produce a website like this (e.g. using Git with R, using GitHub to host websites, R-Markdown, basic CSS styling). These skills firmly fall outside of the requirements for this course, but something you can build on in your spare time and over your future career. Believe it or not, we as lecturers are also always still learning - particularly, as you’ll find if you continue in spatial data science, the tools and technology available to us is continuously changing! Content-wise, the lectures and practicals for this course are all original this year to the Geography Department at UCL. There is some overlap between this course and the Principles of Spatial Analysis module that is run at the Master’s level, e.g. the extensions offered in several of the practicals. Aesthetics-wise, the R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst much of the artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desirée De Leon, as well as by Jo. You can find Allison’s images on the stats illustration GitHub repository and Desirée’s on the rstudio4edu GitHub repository. Yihui Xie’s Authoring Books with R Markdown and rstudio4edu’s book, A Handbook for Teaching and Learning with R and RStudio were key resources in the creation and editing of this book. In addition, the CASA0005 practical handbook (by Dr Andy MacLachan and Adam Dennett) alongside our own Principles of Spatial Analysis practical handbook (by myself and Justin van Dijk) served as inspiration for the structure and formatting of this book. For some practicals, additional acknowledgements are made at the end where code or inspiration has also been borrowed! Noticed a mistake in this resource?

"],["module-information.html", "Module Information Self-guided learning for Geocomputation Reading List Troubleshooting Module Content Feedback: Weekly and End of Module", " Module Information If you’ll read one page of this entire workbook in depth, please make sure it is this one!. The following page outlines exactly how we hope you will engage with online learning for this course. Running a practical-based course online is not easy - for both lecturers and students alike! To help, we’ve tried to break down our content into short chunks, using a mix of recorded lecture videos, recorded practical and coding videos, as well as recommended reading and even short explanations of our own. Self-guided learning for Geocomputation The majority of your learning this year for Geocomputation will be ‘self-guided’ - however this is not to say, you’ll be learning alone. We’ll be running fortnightly seminars to check-in on your progress and discuss what you’ve learnt in our small groups (attendance is recorded), whilst also encouraging you to attend (optional) Help/ Study Group sessions on the weeks the seminars are not held. In addition, you’ll have small Assignments to complete, that we’re (time-permitted) hoping to provide you with small feedback on, either during the seminars or through discussion forums (held either on Teams or Moodle, depending on requirements, instructions will be provided as and when). Geocomputation Timetable A typical fortnight for Geocomputation will look something like this: Tuesday 10am: New content is released. Friday 5pm: Post/Send Assignment submissions for online feedback (Optional, but recommended) Monday/Tuesday (allocated slots): Help/Study Group, run by Jakub and Nikki - get help on your practical work if you’ve been unable to submit your work, bring articles you’ve read for discussion, discuss your feedback, and catch-up with friends! Tuesday 10am: New content is released. Friday 5pm: Post/send assignment submissions for seminar (if required) Monday/Tuesday (allocated slots): Seminar, run by Jo - discuss content for the last two weeks, bring articles you’ve read for discussion, discuss your feedback, and ask questions! And repeat! There will of course be a break for Reading Week where we will set you a short Coding Challenge to complete ready for the seminar at the start of the second half of term. In addition to our scheduled fortnightly help sessions, there will also be the weekly Coding Therapy classes run by PhD students within the Department to help you with coding issues if you get stuck and can’t wait for our help sessions. Please do use these classes in addition to our Help Sessions - they are there to help you with any module that requires any type of programming, not just Geocomputation, as well as your Dissertation! We will also provide some additional help sessions in the first two weeks of the Easter break to help you with your first Assessment. The hours for this are TBC. What will I be learning each week? As you’ll soon find out, you will learn a lot of different things in Geocomputation - from spatial analysis techniques to understanding how to write code to process and analyse data, as well as how to organise your investigation and use statistical and spatial analysis to answer research questions. To help, we have broken the course into three main sections: Foundational Concepts Core Spatial Analysis Advanced Spatial Analysis We hope this helps with the various learning curves you’re about to embark on - as outlined and explained further in Week 1’s content. The topics covered over the next ten weeks are: Week Date Section Topic Online Session 1 11/01/2021 Foundational Concepts Geocomputation: An Introduction N/A 2 18/01/2021 Foundational Concepts GIScience and GIS software Seminar 3 25/01/2021 Foundational Concepts Cartography and Visualisation I Help/Study Groups 4 01/02/2021 Foundational Concepts Programming (for Statistical Analysis) Seminar 5 08/02/2021 Foundational Concepts Programming for Spatial Analysis &amp; ESDA Help/Study Groups READING WEEK READING WEEK READING WEEK CODING CHALLENGE - - 6 22/02/2021 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns I: Spatial Auto-Correlation &amp; Regression Seminar 7 01/03/2021 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns II: Clusters Help/Study Groups 8 08/03/2021 Core Spatial Analysis Rasters, Zonal Statistics and Interpolation Seminar 9 15/03/2021 Advanced Spatial Analysis Geodemographics Help/Study Groups 10 22/03/2021 Cartography &amp; Visualisation Cartography and Visualisation II Seminar The lectures and practicals of this course only form a part of the learning process. You are expected to undertake wider reading (see the Reading List below), particularly to help with your second assessment. In addition to our course, there are many other online resources and tutorials that can help expand on the topics and content we cover - whilst it is not necessary for your assessments, you are encouraged to go beyond our recommendations and fully engage with applied GIS research, methods and visualisation techniques. Following certain ‘movers and shakers’ in the GIScience / Spatial Data Science world is one approach to learn more about what’s happening in the field and might prove inspirational for your dissertation ideas later this year. Reading List We link to books and resources throughout each practical. The full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course. Alternatively, you can always easily find the link to the Reading List in the top right of any Moodle page for our module, under “Library Resources”. This Reading List will be updated on a weekly basis, in preparation for the week to come, so you may see some weeks without reading for now. But please check back at the start of each week as the lecture, seminar and/or workshop material is released for that week to check for new readings. All reading for that week will be provided by the time your learning materials are released - so you will not need to check the reading list for updates as the week progresses. Troubleshooting Module Content Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with - particularly when we combine this with learning how to program at the same time. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash, you’ll end up with bugs in your code that are difficult to find, and you may spend a whole day trying to track down a single dataset. But the rewards of learning how to do all of this (particularly with this year’s emphasis on this online research for your dissertations) will become apparent. To bring in my first of potentially several cycling references, a well-known quote from Tour De France (1986, 1989, 1990) winner Greg Lemond: “It never gets easier, you just go faster.” Resonates quite well with spatial analysis and programming! Even after years of programming, we can still forget the syntax to a for loop or question what kernel density estimation actually shows, but you will - by the end of the next ten weeks - know how to find out the answers to these problems faster! Beyond the help sessions mentioned above, if you need specific assistance with this course please: Attend the fortnightly GIS/coding help sessions (from Week 3) to ask questions directly to Jakub or Nikki. Post in the respective tech-help or r-help channels within the Geocomputation Team. Ask a question at the end of a seminar (time-permitting) Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to the assessment (more information will be provided in Week 5) Attend the Coding Therapy sessions that are run on a weekly basis Due to the size of the class we will only reply to tech and R help messages on Teams so all students can see the discussion. If you have a personal matter in relation to completing the course then please speak to or email Jo. We’d also encourage you to monitor the tech-help or r-help channels and contribute to/answer questions as/if you can! Creating a small community across our course will help all of us in the long-run. If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help, you can book into our office hours. These meetings are to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module. Additional Online Help &amp; Resources We are here to help you work through these practicals but even we do not know everything. Therefore, it’s a good idea to become familar with online sources of help, such as: Stack Exchange RStudio community QGIS documemtation R documentation ArcGIS help pages Ultimately, if you are struggling to use R don’t worry…here is some advice from a tweet and interview with Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at RStudio… You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally — Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) 11. Februar 2015 It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. We highly advocate taking a break if you get stuck - the Workbook will not disappear, and you can complete the content at your own pace! Expanding your R learning (to infinity and beyond!) In addition to our course, there are many online tutorials that can help with learning R, specifically: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R Feedback: Weekly and End of Module We can only make this course better through your feedback. We collect feedback: At the end of every practical. There is a link to an anonymous feedback form, please let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session. At the end of the module. The standard UCL feedback form will be available to fill in on Moodle. Acknowledgements Part of this page is adapted from CASA0005. "],["what-is-this-workbook.html", "What is this Workbook?

"],["software-installation.html", "Software Installation QGIS R and R-Studio ArcGIS Installation Issues", " Software Installation This course primarily uses the R data science programming language and we strongly advise you complete the assignment using it. We briefly touch upon QGIS in the first few weeks to give you a basic foundation in spatial analysis alongside the range of spatial software available. Please follow the instructions below before completing the first practical session (in Week 2) to install the software on your local computer. Alternatively, both software are available on UCL’s computers and therefore can be accessed through Desktop Anywhere - however depending on your internet connection, this may be slow to use and, as a result, a highly frustrating experience! As outlined below, we have an online version of R-Studio available for use, but as yet, we do not have one for Q-GIS. If you are unable to download Q-GIS for your own computer, please let us know through the form below. QGIS QGIS is an open-source graphic user interface GIS with many community developed add-on packages (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. To get QGIS on your personal machine go to: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html We recommend installing the OSGeo4W version. The nature of open-source means that several programs will rely on each other for features. OSGeo4W tracks all the shared requirements and does not install any duplicates. R and R-Studio R is both a programming language and software environment - in the form of R-Studio- originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. R’s great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system and free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical and importantly for us, geographical tasks. R-Studio Setup 1 Search for and open RStudio. You can install R Studio on your own machine from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download R studio requires R which you can download from: https://cran.rstudio.com/ RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R — it makes R much easier to use. If you are using a Mac and run into issues, firstly follow the instructions below then check out the [Mac R issues] section if the problem persists. R-Studio Setup 2 UCL students (and staff) can now also make use of R Studio Server. It’s RStudio on a webpage, so no installation is required. Access information will be provided on Moodle in Week 2. ArcGIS ArcGIS Pro (previously ArcMap) is the main commercial GIS software that you may have already used - or seen/heard about through other modules or even job aderts. We do not use ArcGIS Pro in our Practicals for several reasons: Computing requirements for ArcGIS Pro are substantial and it only operates on the Windows Operating System. For Mac users, using ArcGIS Pro (and ArcMap) would require using iether a Virtual Machine or “splitting your own harddrive” to install a Windows OS. It is proprietary software, which means you need a license to use the software. For those of us in education, the University covers the cost of this license, but when you leave, you will need to pay for a personal license (around £100!) to continue using the software and repeat any analysis you’ve used the software for. Whilst ArcPro can use pure Python (and even R) as a programming language within it through scripts and notebooks, it primarily relies on its own ArcPy and ArcGIS API for Python packages to run the in-built tools and analytical functions. To use these packages, you still need a license which makes it difficult to share your code with others if they do not have their own ArcGIS license. Recent developments in the ArcPro software however does make it an attractive tool for spatial data science - it has cross-user functionality, from data analysts who like to use a tool called Notebooks for their code development, to those focused more on cartography and visualisation with in-built bridges to Adobe’s Creative Suite. We therefore do not want to put you off looking into ArcGIS in the future, but for this course, we want to ensure the reproducibility of work (you’ll learn more about this in Week 1’s lectures). Therefore, the analysis for your coursework must be completed in R/R-Studio and QGIS (where permissible, see guidance in Week 5). Installation Issues If you have any issues with installing either Q-GIS or R, please let us know during Week 1 via the tech-help channel within the Geocomputation Team. PLEASE CONFIRM YOUR SOFTWARE INSTALLATION We would appreciate it if you can fill in this Installation Confirmation Form to confirm whether you have been able to install the relevant software by Friday 15th January 2021 5pm UK time.

"],["geocomputation-an-introduction.html", "1 Geocomputation: An Introduction Getting Ready for our Practicals", " 1 Geocomputation: An Introduction Welcome to the first week of Geocomputation! Week 1 in Geocomp This week’s content provides you with a thorough introduction into what is Geocomputation, outlining how and why it is different to a traditional ‘GIScience’ course. We set the scene for the remainder of the module and explain how the foundational concepts that you’ll learn about in the first half of term fit together to form the overall Geocomputation curriculum. We also outline how the course is a great step towards those interested in a career in (spatial) data science. For this week only, there is no practical per se, but you will need to complete a few practical tasks in preparation for our future practicals. We appreciate that to get to this point in our content, you will have read a lot on both the Moodle and Coursebook and we do have a few readings we’d like you to do in anticipation of next week’s seminar. There are however 3 assignments that we’d like you to complete, two of which involve setting up your computer ready for next week’s practical. Learning Objectives By the end of this week, you should be able to: Understand the differences between traditional GIScience and Geocomputation Explain what spatial analysis is and why it is important for Geocomputation Understand why we will use programming as our main tool for data analysis Know how you will access both of required software for this course: QGIS and R-Studio Establish good file management practices, ready for the module’s practical content, starting next week. What is Geocomputation? According to Lovelace et al (2020): Geocomputation is a young term, dating back to the first conference on the subject in 1996…[Geocomputation] is closely related to other terms including: Geographic Information Science (GIScience); Geomatics; Geoinformatics; Spatial Information Science; [Spatial Data Science]; and Geographic Data Science (GDS). Each term shares an emphasis on a ‘scientific’ (implying reproducible and falsifiable) approach influenced by GIS, although their origins and main fields of application differ. GDS, for example, emphasizes ‘data science’ skills and large datasets, while Geoinformatics tends to focus on data structures…Geocomputation is a recent term but is influenced by old ideas. It can be seen as a part of Geography, which has a 2000+ year history (Talbert 2014); and an extension of Geographic Information Science and Systems (Neteler and Mitasova 2008), which emerged in the 1960s (Coppock and Rhind 1991). Geocomputation is part of but also separate to the wider discipline of GIScience (and Systems). As geographers, particularly ones at UCL, you are likely to have come across GIScience in one of its many forms, including the use of GIScience software, known simply as GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap. What differentiates Geocomputation from traditional GIScience is that it is: working with geographic data in a computational way, focusing on code, reproducibility and modularity. Lovelace et al, 2020 We would also add that its main focus is on the analysis of data, rather than wider technological and informational challenges that GIScience also addresses. Suggested Reading If you’d like to read where the above quote is from, you’re welcome to get ahead of Week 5’s reading by looking at Lovelace et al (2020) linked below. This is just suggested reading for this week - and may make a little more sense when we come to Week 5. But there’s always benefits in doing (and reading!) things twice. Book Chapter (10 mins): Lovelace et al, An Introduction to Geocomputation with R, Preface and Introduction. What is important to recognise is that Geocomputation benefits from many of the epistemological and ontological developments that were made in the 1960s onwards within GIScience to enable us now to process substantial amount of spatial data, geographic and non-geographic, at signficiant speeds and visualise our results accordingly. This includes how we capture, record and store the world around us in a digital format, how to take this data and turn it into insight and also the more technical issues of data formats, storing assigned metadata such as projections, and ensuring cross-compatibility across different GIS software and programming languages. Key Definitions Geographic refers to space on the earth’s surface and near-surface. Non-geographic can refer to other types of space, such as network and graph space. The use of spatial incorporates both geographic and non-geographic space. You’ll also see geospatial analysis mentioned which subset of spatial analysis applied specifically to the Earth’s surface and near-surface. Although there are subtle distinctions between the terms geographic(al), spatial, and geospatial, for many practical purposes they can be used interchangeably. Within this module, our focus will be on how we can analyse spatial data in a computational way to address specific research questions - we will try to focus on issues that often concern geographers, including socio-economic and environmental challenges, such as driving factors of crime and deprivation, inequalities in access to greenspace and food and health establishments, and exposure to environmental concerns, such as poor air quality. To achieve this, we need to draw on specific foundational concepts from GIScience, such as spatial data models and data interoperability (Week 2), Cartography and Visualisation, including map projections (Week 3), alongside traditional Data Analysis, including using Statistics (Week 4), and also learn how to Program effectively and efficiently, particularly when it comes to using spatial data (Week 4 and 5). The remainder of this week’s content provides you with a brief introduction into each of these foundational concepts for Geocomputation. Before you get started with the rest of this week’s content, however, we’d like you to make sure you’ve installed the software ready for next week. It should also serve as a good break between reading and watching our lecture videos. Assignment 1: Download Q-GIS and R-Studio software Your first assignment for this week is to complete the steps found in Software Installation and complete the Installation Confirmation Form once done. GIScience: A Short History Almost everything that happens, happens somewhere. Longley et al, 2015 Geographic information has an important role across a multitude of applications, from epidemiology, disaster management and demography, to resource management, urban and transport planning, infrastructure modelling and many more. With almost all human activities involving an important geographic component, understanding where something happens – and also why – can often be the most critically important piece of information when decisions need to be made that are likely to affect individuals, communities, our increasingly connected societies, as well as the environment and ecology that exist in the area of study. Current methods of analysing geographic information have its roots firmly within the discipline of Geographic Information Science (GIScience), which first came into prominence in the 60s and 70s as the first Geographic Information System (GIS) was conceptualised by the “Father of Geographic Information Science and Systems”: Roger Tomlinson. He formalised the ideas within his Doctoral Thesis here at UCL in 1974, under the title “The application of electronic computing methods and techniques to the storage, compilation, and assessment of mapped data”. Whilst the thesis is nearly fifty years old, much of its content remains extensively relevant to the problems faced by the collection and processing of geographic data and analysis of geographic information today. Furthermore, he identifies two important requirements for the success of GIScience: Within the discipline of geography, it is suggested that the mutual development of formal spatial models and geographic information systems will lead to future beneficial shifts of emphasis in both fields of endeavour. Tomlinson, 1974 For GIScience to work as a discipline, there was a need to focus on both the development of spatial modelling (i.e. how to represent and analyse real world spatial phenomena in digital systems as spatial data) and of geographic information systems (i.e. how this data is stored, managed, retrieved, queried and visualised as information). Much of Tomlinson’s work contributed to establishing both the spatial models and GISystems we use today - and UCL has remained active in the development of this knowledge, culminating in our course textbook by Professor Paul Longley et al, who you will find in our Department. The foundations of GIScience have been built upon, with fifty years of development in the digital collection, recording, management, sharing and analysis of geographic data and information. For spatial modelling, the discipline has seen researchers develop and implement new methods and techniques of spatial representation and analysis to augment and extend the capabilities of working with spatial data. For GIS, the discipline has spawned a new industry focusing on the (commercial) development of GIS tools, software and applications. These tools have enabled different types of GIS, from databases to analytical software to online data services and servers. Furthermore, for both to work in unison with one another, GIScience has seen the establishment of the Open Geospatial Consortium, which aims to provide consensus on the standards and codes used with geographic data, information, content and services. The following short lecture provides an introduction to GIScience, including the topics that we’ll cover in more detail in next week’s lecture and practical. What is GIScience: past, present and future Slides | Video on Stream In addition to the short lecture, and in preparation for next week’s seminar, please read the following two Book Chapters: Key Reading(s) Book (15 mins): Longley et al, 2015, Geographic Information Science &amp; Systems, Chapter 1: Geographic information: Science, Systems, and Society. Article (15 mins): Albrecht, J. (2020). Philosophical Perspectives. The Geographic Information Science &amp; Technology Body of Knowledge. We’ll cover the history of GIS software in a little more detail next week. Spatial Analysis: An Overview “80% of all data is geographic.” A geographer Whilst no one really knows the origin of this urban legend within GIScience, it is a quote that has been heavily used across the GIScience industry to explain the importance of spatial analysis and the untapped potential of spatial data. It is incredible to believe that just over a decade ago, when I was in your exact position, there was a need to justify why studying, collecting and analysing geographic information was important. In just over a decade, we have now seen a substantial transformation where analysing geographic data is no longer a niche activity, but almost omnipresent to our personal lives and our society at large. Suggested Reading Article (3 mins): Forbes, 2020, Mapping the way forward: GIS is powering solutions to global challenges We now have an entire map in our pocket, which not only provides us with spatial analysis on the fly, but the device on which this map exists itself provides data to others to conduct spatial analysis on our own behaviours. Not only can we find out the best route for us to drive to our favourite park at the touch of a button, we can also passively inform others on how long it will take them to get there too. We all now actively create, use and analyse spatial data - whether we are aware of it or not! The question that has faced those working in GIScience - and now in fields and disciplines beyond - is how to formalise these analyses into identifiable and, importantly, rigorous methods and techniques. Over the course of this module, we’ll introduce you to some of the core and advanced analysis methods that will be essential to analysing spatial data, including geometric operations, spatial autocorrelation, spatial regression, cluster analysis, interpolation and network analysis. These methods have been developed by those working actively in GIScience and spatial analysis, such as Dr Luc Anselin and his development of spatial autocorrelation methods. What you’ll learn - and quickly find out through your own application of these analysis methods - is that understanding the theory and principles behind them is just essential as knowing how to implement them, either through GIS software or programming. The following short lecture provides an introduction to spatial analysis and the techniques you’ll come across in the following weeks. Spatial Analysis: A key component of GIScience and beyond Slides | Video on Stream Assignment 2: Spatial Analysis and the COVID-19 Pandemic For your second assignment this week, we’d like to you think about how spatial analysis has been used in the current pandemic (don’t worry, this is one of the few times we’ll reference it moving forward!). Prior to next’s week seminar (and preferably by Friday 5pm), we’d like you to submit a short description (100~ words or less!) of an application you may be using, or have seen in the news, where you think spatial analysis has been critical to its success. You don’t need to know exactly how spatial analysis is being used, but you’re welcome to make a guess - you can also submit a reference as well, if you’d like. Also - an application does not necessary mean a phone app, but can be a tool, website, or dashboard - or anything else you can think of that has a spatial component to it! Please submit your description here! Programming for Data Analysis Concurrent to the developments within GIScience and spatial analysis, particularly over the last twenty years or so, we have begun to see a growing dataficaton of our everyday lives, where we: “take all aspects of life and turn them into data.” Cukier &amp; Mayer-Schöenberg, 2013 Our personal use of digital sensors - from our mobile phone data, use of online social networks and fitness trackers, to our travel and credit card - has created a deluge of data, most commonly known as ‘big data’. What sets ‘big data’ apart from traditional data is these data are often substantial in their volume, velocity and variety - making them difficult to manage, store, process and analyse. The hope, however, has been with big data is that by harnessing and ‘wrangling’ ita, we will be able to derive new insight from this data that can help address real world challenges, from something as simple as Google’s Traffic alerts within its Maps application, to tracking food security in areas where access for surveys are unfeasible. For GIScience and spatial analysis, what is important to note is that this data deluge and resulting specialisation has created a new approach to the analysis of data that goes beyond traditional data analysis, known as data science, which has worked its way into analysis streams and lexicon of many industries, from commercial organisations to academic research institutions. What distinguishes data science from traditional data analysis is that data scientists are able extract knowledge from these substantial datasets by using an intersection of three skills: hacking skills (or computational skills), statistical analysis and domain expertise. These computational skills - in the form of 1) programming, 2) distributed computing and 3) large-scale (complex) analysis - often set these data analysts apart from their traditional counterparts. The increasing popularity of data science is having a signficant impact on how we “do” spatial anaysis as more and more data scientists become involved with spatial analysis as, for many of these datasets, location is a key component for its management, processing and analysis - after all, everything happens somewhere. Concomittantly, there has also been an growing availability and accessibility of other geographical data, such as satellite and UAV imagery, that have significant interest to those working in these computational fields, such as computer vision and machine learning, such as extracting building and/or roads from true-colour satellite imagery. As a result, the “world” of geographic information has transformed rapidly from a data-scarce to a data-rich environment (Miller and Goodchild, 2015) and has garnered significant interest from those who do not necessarily consider themselves as working within the GIScience discipline. Their involvement has increased the utility of computational tools, such as programming languages and data servers, to ensure that traditional programming, data analysis and statistical langauges, such as Python and R can incorporate and conduct spatial analysis. This has involved the creation of many GIScience and spatial analysis focused libraries or packages (to be explained further in Week 4) within these programming languages, that have enabled analysts and researchers to run specific techniques or algorithms (such as calculating a buffer around a specific point) but for substantially larger datasets than traditional software can normally handle. Whilst this adoption of spatial analysis and GIS by non-GIScience practitioners certainly has (and continues to have) its pitfalls (as you’ll see later on in the module), there is also a growing influence and appeal of data science to many working in GIScience (and its related fields) – including its focus on analysing large-scale datasets that may have the potential to study geographic phenomena at unprecedented scales and detail. Unlike GIScience of ten years ago, there is, as a result, a pertinent need to teach these computational skills - first in the form of programming - to you as future GIS analysts, researchers or even data scientists, alongside the theory and principles of spatial analysis and the wider GIScience knowledge base. As you might guess where this is going, our focus on Geocomputation is a first step in this direction - which you may build upon in your third year, following through with modules such as Mining Social and Geographic Datasets. The following short lecture outlines the key reasons why we should program for spatial analysis: Slides | Video on Stream Programmming vs. GUI-GIS If you’ve not programmed before, the learning curve to program can be daunting - and also very frustrating! To be honest, even when you know how to program, it can still be incredibly frustrating! But the benefits of being able to program your data processing and analysis using a Command Line Interface (CLI) program, compared to using a traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) sotware, are substantial. This does not mean using a GUI GIS does not have purpose or its own advantages. In my opinion, GUI GIS are incredibly useful tools to understand the “spatialness” of your spatial data and your spatial analysis, particularly when looking at spatial operations and spatial neighbours. The scripting aspect of R/Python often shield or hide you from this spatiality, which when you’re starting out with GIS and spatial analysis, is also an important learning curve! Furthermore, with GUI GIS, if you are interested in making paper-based maps and establishing your own “James Cheshire and Oliver Uberti” coffee table map books, learning map-making in a GUI GIS can be incredibly helpful in terms of understanding the flexibility of styling, label placement etc. ArcGIS, for example, has bridges with Adobe and its Creative Suite catalogue of software, enabling you to easily format maps you’ve made in ArcGIS Pro within Illustrator and/or InDesign. As a result, for the first two weeks of practicals - and part of the final practical - we will use Q-GIS so you have a basic understanding of how to use the software, and can then develop your use of the software outside of our course if and when you need. To understand more about what spatial (geographic) data science is (and why we program!), please read our other two key readings for this week: Key Reading(s) Article (25 mins): Brunsdon and Comber, 2020, Opening Practice: Supporting Reproducibility and Critical Spatial Data Scinece Article (10 mins): Singleton and Arribas-Bel, 2019, Geographic Data Science, Geographic Analysis In addition, you can watch this short video from Carto, a major commercial organisation working in several aspects of spatial data science. It outlines these key skills you’ll need to learn to become a competent spatial data scientist, including an understanding of spatial data, which many data scientists often lack prior to engaging with spatial data. Carto’s ‘What is spatial data science’ video What’s next for us in Geocomputation We believe strongly that effective users of GI systems require some awareness of all aspects of geographic information, from the basic principles and techniques to concepts of management and familiarity with applications. Longley et al, 2015 pg.32 For the next few weeks, we’ll be taking a deeper look at many of these foundational concepts that will ultimately enable you to be able to confidently and competently analyse spatial data using both programming and GIS software. As you might guess, you’ll therefore be going on many learning curves over the coming weeks - some that may feel familiar (e.g. applying descriptive statistics) and others that are more challenging (e.g. learning how to write code and debug it as you find errors). To help with this, I highly recommend that you try to stay organised with your work, including taking notes and making yourself a coding handbook. I’d also list the different datasets you come across - and importantly, the scales and different projections you use them at - more on this in the next two weeks. Finally, you should also make notes about the different spatial analysis techniques you’ll come across, including the different properties they assess and parameters they require to run. Furthermore, over the next nine weeks, you’ll learn how to plan, structure and conduct your own spatial analysis using programming – whilst making decisions on how to best present your work, which is a crucial aspect of any type of investigation but of particular relevance to your dissertation. Establishing an organised file system, for both your data and your documents, is essential to working effectively and efficiently as a researcher, whether in Gecomputation, Spatial Data Science or any other application you might think of! To this end, we move to the final part of our content for this week: creating our folders to establish good File Management procedures. Getting Ready for our Practicals To get ready for our practicals, which start next week, we would like you to set-up a file management system as follows (either on your local computer or DesktopAnywhere VM) - this will also help ensure any code you use from Week 4 onwards works without issue (*theoretically!): Create a GEOG0030 folder in your Documents folder on your computer (most likely inside a UCL or Undergrad or Geography folder, and then again within a Year 2 folder - although we are not mindreaders here ;) ). Next, within your GEOG0030 folder, create the following subfolders: data lecture_slides maps qgis notes any other folder types you may think you need for this course (although you can of course add these as the module continues) Note the _ separating the two words in lecture_slides folder. PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE ANY GAPS INBETWEEN YOUR FOLDER NAMES (OR FILE NAMES). We will explain why in our seminar next week. Also note we do not use any capitals in our folder names. Within your data folder, create the following subfolders: raw working final If you’ve downloaded the lecture slides, move these into your lecture_slides folder. We’ll explain more about establishing good file management procedures in the seminar at the beginning of next week. Assignment 3 Follow the above guidelines to create your folders in your local system ready for our practicals to begin next week. And that’s it. You’re now ready to start our practicals next week. We look forward to meeting you all in our first seminars next week and address any questions you might have from this week’s content! Week 1 Recap This week, we’ve provided you with an introduction to the Foundational Concepts you’ll be coming across in our course as we train you to become competent spatial data analysist. You should now: Understand the differences between traditional GIScience and Geocomputation. Be able to explain what spatial analysis is and why it is important for Geocomputation. Understand why we will use programming as our main tool for data analysis. Know how you will access both of required software for this course: QGIS and R-Studio - or flagged this as an issue to us via the form! Have created your file system for GEOG0030 ready to practice good file management for the module’s practical content, starting next week.
