[["index.html", "Geocomputation 2020-2021 Work Book Module Introduction", " Geocomputation 2020-2021 Work Book Module Introduction Welcome to this year’s Geocomputation module, a course that introduces you to both the principles of spatial analysis and the use of programming for data analysis. Over the next ten weeks, you’ll learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis whilst implementing small research projects, first using Q-GIS, and then using the R programming language within the R-Studio software environment. You’ll learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socio-economic datasets, and then analyse them using core spatial and statistical analysis techniques. The course is an excellent precursor for those of you interested in a career in (spatial) data science! The course will consist of approximately 10 lectures, 10 self-led practicals, 5 seminars (held online) and 5 coding help sessions (held online), further details of which are provided on the next page, Course Information. For now, if you’ve not watched the Introduction video on Moodle, you can catch up below: Geocomputation Introductory Video Remember you must have joined our Geocomputation Team on Microsoft Teams to be able to watch our lecture videos - instructions are provided on Moodle. Getting in touch during the module The module is convened and taught by Dr Joanna Wilkin - you can contact her at j.wilkin [at] ucl.ac.uk or, for online office hours, you can book a half hour slot using MS Bookings. The module is further supported by two Postgraduate Teaching Assistants: Jakub (Kuba) Wyszomierski and Nikki Tanu. They will host coding help sessions on the alternative weeks to our scheduled seminar sessions. Acknowledgements Putting together a workbook such as this is no easy feat - but it’s also something that after a little time with R-Studio, you’d be able to produce! The reason for this, as we’ll repeat throughout the course, is that there is an incredible amount of resources available online that can help you learn the skills required to produce a website like this (e.g. using Git with R, using GitHub to host websites, R-Markdown, basic CSS styling). These skills firmly fall outside of the requirements for this course, but something you can build on in your spare time and over your future career. Believe it or not, we as lecturers are also always still learning - particularly, as you’ll find if you continue in spatial data science, the tools and technology available to us is continuously changing! Content-wise, the lectures and practicals for this course are all original this year to the Geography Department at UCL. There is some overlap between this course and the Principles of Spatial Analysis module that is run at the Master’s level, e.g. the extensions offered in several of the practicals. Aesthetics-wise, the R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst much of the artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desirée De Leon, as well as myself. You can find Allison’s images on the stats illustration GitHub repository and Desirée’s on the rstudio4edu GitHub repository. Yihui Xie’s Authoring Books with R Markdown and rstudio4edu’s book, A Handbook for Teaching and Learning with R and RStudio were key resources in the creation and editing of this book. In addition, the CASA0005 practical handbook (by Dr Andy MacLachan and Adam Dennett) alongside our own Principles of Spatial Analysis practical handbook (by myself and Justin van Dijk) served as inspiration for the structure and formatting of this book. For some practicals, additional acknowledgements are made at the end where code or inspiration has also been borrowed! Noticed a mistake in this resource?

You are expected to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with applied GIS research, methods and visualisation techniques. If you find a practical particularly easy or straightforward then please move on to the next one. Practicals that look at analytical relationships also have extension activities for you to try. Online Help &amp; Resources Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash. The academic staff are here to help you work through these practicals but we do not know everything. It’s a good idea to become familar with online sources of help, such as: Stack Exchange RStudio community QGIS documemtation R documentation ArcGIS help pages Reading list We link to books and resources throughout each practical. The full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course. Alternatively, you can always easily find the link to the Reading List in the top right of any Moodle page for our module, under “Library Resources”. This Reading List will be updated on a weekly basis, in preparation for the week to come, so you may see some weeks without reading for now. But please check back at the start of each week as the lecture, seminar and/or workshop material is released for that week to check for new readings. All reading for that week will be provided by the time your learning materials are released - so you will not need to check the reading list for updates as the week progresses. More help If you need specific assistance with this course please: Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to assignments / deadlines. There is also an expected assignment timeline and frequently asked questions section within the assessment outline document. Speak to a member of the teaching team in the computer lab sessions Ask a question at the end of a lecture (time permitting) Ask a question on slack under the GIS channel— you should have recevied an invite email from Steve Gray otherwise use this link. The teaching team will monitor this — use the #gis channel for this course. Due to the size of the class we will only reply to messages on slack so all students can see the discussion. If you have a personal matter in relation to completing the course then please speak to or email Andy or Adam. If you are struggling to use R don’t worry…here is some advice from a tweet and interview with Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at RStudio… You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally — Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) 11. Februar 2015 It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You can also go through other free resources including: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R At the end of every practical there is a link anonymous Google feeback form, let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session. If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help you can book into our office hours. These meetings are to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module.

All course content, including lectures and practical material, will be contained within this Workbook (hence it’s name!). As outlined earlier, you will also need to be part of our Geocomputation Team to have access to the lectures within the workbook. Any official course requirements (e.g. submission links for assessments) will be on Moodle. Each week’s content will be uploaded to the Workbook for Tuesday 10am UK time after the third seminar or coding help sessions. Using this Workbook Alongisde the recorded lectures and practical instructions, key things to look out for in the Workbook are Assignments, which are short optional submissions, Key Reading(s) and Points of Information, including Learning Objectives, Tips and Recap. To help, we’ll try to highlight them as follows: Assignment Each week, you’ll have 1-3 short assignments where we would like you to submit either a response, map or code prior to our seminar session or have it ready to present during the session itself. Key Reading(s) The recommended readings for this week will be highlighted in a Reading Box as and when appropriate in the week’s content. You’ll be able to find direct links to them within the E-Reading list. Learning Objectives Each week, we’ll start with a highlight of the learning objectives we hope you’ll achieve through the practical and lecture content. Get Ahead Tips Tips for effective note-taking during the practicals such as recording the functions you end up using in our practicals and your understanding of the arguments that they require. Recap A recap at the end of each section or week - make sure you take a note of these and are confident that you understand the points addressed.

"],["software-installation.html", "Software Installation QGIS R ArcGIS Installation Issues Confirm Installation", " Software Installation This course primarily uses the R data science programming language and we strongly advise you complete the assignment using it. We briefly touch upon QGIS in the first few weeks to give you a basic foundation in spatial analysis alongside the range of spatial software available. Please follow the instructions below before completing the first practical session to install the software on your local computer if you are planning to use it throughout the course. QGIS QGIS is an open-source graphic user interface GIS with many community developed add-on packages (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. To get QGIS on your personal machine go to: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html I install the OSGeo4W version. The nature of open-source means that several programs will rely on each other for features. OSGeo4W tracks all the shared requirements and does not install any duplicates. R R is both a programming language and software environment, originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. R’s great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system and free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical and importantly for us, geographical tasks. Setup 1 Search for and open RStudio. You can install R Studio on your own machine from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download R studio requires R which you can download from: https://cran.rstudio.com/ RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R — it makes R much easier to use. If you are using a Mac and run into issues, firstly follow the instructions below then check out the [Mac R issues] section if the problem persists. Setup 2 UCL students (and staff) can now also make use of R Studio Server. It’s RStudio on a webpage, so no installation is required. Access information will be provided on Moodle in Week 2. ArcGIS ArcGIS Pro (previously ArcMap) is the main commercial GIS software that you may have already used - or seen/heard about through other modules or even job aderts. We do not use ArcGIS Pro in our Practicals for several reasons: Computing requirements for ArcGIS Pro are substantial and it only operates on the Windows Operating System. For Mac users, using ArcGIS Pro (and ArcMap) would require using iether a Virtual Machine or “splitting your own harddrive” to install a Windows OS. It is proprietary software, which means you need a license to use the software. For those of us in education, the University covers the cost of this license, but when you leave, you will need to pay for a personal license (around £100!) to continue using the software and repeat any analysis you’ve used the software for. Whilst ArcPro can use pure Python (and even R) as a programming language within it through scripts and notebooks, it primarily relies on its own ArcPy and ArcGIS API for Python packages to run the in-built tools and analytical functions. To use these packages, you still need a license which makes it difficult to share your code with others if they do not have their own ArcGIS license. Recent developments in the ArcPro software however does make it an attractive - it has cross-user functionality, from data analyts to those focused more on cartography and visualisation with in-built bridges to Adobe’s Creative Suite. We therefore do not want to put you off looking into ArcGIS in the future, but be However, the analysis for your coursework must be done in either R and/or QGIS (where permissible, see guidance in Week 5). Installation Issues If you have any issues with installing either Q-GIS or R, please let us know during Week 1 via the tech-help channel within the Geocomputation Team. Confirm Installation We would appreciate it if you can fill in this Installation confirmation form to confirm whether you have been able to install the relevant software.
