[["index.html", "Geocomputation 2020-2021 Work Book Module Introduction Learning Objectives", " Geocomputation 2020-2021 Work Book Module Introduction Welcome to this year’s Geocomputation module, a course that introduces you to both the principles of spatial analysis and the use of programming for data analysis. Over the next ten weeks, you’ll learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis whilst implementing small research projects, first using Q-GIS, and then using the R programming language within the R-Studio software environment. You’ll learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socio-economic datasets, and then analyse them using core spatial and statistical analysis techniques. The course is an excellent precursor for those of you interested in a career in (spatial) data science! The course will consist of approximately 10 lectures, 10 self-led practicals, 5 seminars (held online) and 5 coding help sessions (held online), further details of which are provided on the next page, Course Information. For now, if you’ve not watched the Introduction video on Moodle, you can catch up below: Geocomputation Introductory Video Remember you must have joined our Geocomputation Team on Microsoft Teams to be able to watch our lecture videos - instructions are provided on Moodle. Learning Objectives As you’ll have read in the Module Catalogue entry, the main learning objectives for the module are as follows: Understand the ways in which digital representations of the observable world are created, and how representations of neighbourhood communities are built from publicly available Open Data. Gain practical experience of the use of analytical methods to profile small areas of London. Understand the nature of geographic data, and the concepts of spatial autocorrelation, modifiable areal units and neighbourhood classification. Understand the sources and operation of uncertainties in the creation of geographic representations, and the importance of generalisation, abstraction and metadata. Gain practical experience of software, map design and visual communication. Develop practical skills in data acquisition and analytics, which may be useful in the planning of dissertations. We hope that you’ll learn many other things during the module and it inspires you to think about how you might use spatial analysis, GIS and programming in your future career! Getting in touch during the module The module is convened and taught by Dr Joanna Wilkin - you can contact her at j.wilkin [at] ucl.ac.uk or, for online office hours, you can book a half hour slot using MS Bookings. The module is further supported by two Postgraduate Teaching Assistants: Jakub (Kuba) Wyszomierski and Nikki Tanu. They will host coding help sessions on the alternative weeks to our scheduled seminar sessions. Acknowledgements Putting together a workbook such as this is no easy feat - but it’s also something that after a little time with R-Studio, you’d be able to produce! The reason for this, as we’ll repeat throughout the course, is that there is an incredible amount of resources available online that can help you learn the skills required to produce a website like this (e.g. using Git with R, using GitHub to host websites, R-Markdown, basic CSS styling). These skills firmly fall outside of the requirements for this course, but something you can build on in your spare time and over your future career. Believe it or not, we as lecturers are also always still learning - particularly, as you’ll find if you continue in spatial data science, the tools and technology available to us is continuously changing! Content-wise, the lectures and practicals for this course are all original this year to the Geography Department at UCL. There is some overlap between this course and the Principles of Spatial Analysis module that is run at the Master’s level, e.g. the extensions offered in several of the practicals. Aesthetics-wise, the R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by allison_horst, whilst much of the artwork used in information boxes has been produced by Desirée De Leon, as well as by Jo. You can find Allison’s images on the stats illustration GitHub repository and Desirée’s on the rstudio4edu GitHub repository. Yihui Xie’s Authoring Books with R Markdown and rstudio4edu’s book, A Handbook for Teaching and Learning with R and RStudio were key resources in the creation and editing of this book. In addition, the CASA0005 practical handbook (by Dr Andy MacLachan and Adam Dennett) alongside our own Principles of Spatial Analysis practical handbook (by myself and Justin van Dijk) served as inspiration for the structure and formatting of this book. For some practicals, additional acknowledgements are made at the end where code or inspiration has also been borrowed! Noticed a mistake in this resource? Please let us know through the GitHub issues tab, send us a message over MS Teams, or contact us by e-mail. "],["module-information.html", "Module Information Self-guided learning for Geocomputation Reading List Troubleshooting Module Content Feedback: Weekly and End of Module", " Module Information If you’ll read one page of this entire workbook in depth, please make sure it is this one!. The following page outlines exactly how we hope you will engage with online learning for this course. Running a practical-based course online is not easy - for both lecturers and students alike! To help, we’ve tried to break down our content into short chunks, using a mix of recorded lecture videos, recorded practical and coding videos, as well as recommended reading and even short explanations of our own. Self-guided learning for Geocomputation The majority of your learning this year for Geocomputation will be ‘self-guided’ - however this is not to say, you’ll be learning alone. We’ll be running fortnightly seminars to check-in on your progress and discuss what you’ve learnt in our small groups (attendance is recorded), whilst also encouraging you to attend (optional) Help/ Study Group sessions on the weeks the seminars are not held. In addition, you’ll have small Assignments to complete, that we’re (time-permitted) hoping to provide you with small feedback on, either during the seminars or through discussion forums (held either on Teams or Moodle, depending on requirements, instructions will be provided as and when). Geocomputation Timetable A typical fortnight for Geocomputation will look something like this: Tuesday 10am: New content is released. Friday 5pm: Post/Send Assignment submissions for online feedback (Optional, but recommended) Monday/Tuesday (allocated slots): Help/Study Group, run by Jakub and Nikki - get help on your practical work if you’ve been unable to submit your work, bring articles you’ve read for discussion, discuss your feedback, and catch-up with friends! Tuesday 10am: New content is released. Friday 5pm: Post/send assignment submissions for seminar (if required) Monday/Tuesday (allocated slots): Seminar, run by Jo - discuss content for the last two weeks, bring articles you’ve read for discussion, discuss your feedback, and ask questions! And repeat! There will of course be a break for Reading Week where we will set you a short Coding Challenge to complete ready for the seminar at the start of the second half of term. In addition to our scheduled fortnightly help sessions, there will also be the weekly Coding Therapy classes run by PhD students within the Department to help you with coding issues if you get stuck and can’t wait for our help sessions. Please do use these classes in addition to our Help Sessions - they are there to help you with any module that requires any type of programming, not just Geocomputation, as well as your Dissertation! We will also provide some additional help sessions in the first two weeks of the Easter break to help you with your first Assessment. The hours for this are TBC. What will I be learning each week? As you’ll soon find out, you will learn a lot of different things in Geocomputation - from spatial analysis techniques to understanding how to write code to process and analyse data, as well as how to organise your investigation and use statistical and spatial analysis to answer research questions. To help, we have broken the course into three main sections: Foundational Concepts Core Spatial Analysis Advanced Spatial Analysis We hope this helps with the various learning curves you’re about to embark on - as outlined and explained further in Week 1’s content. The topics covered over the next ten weeks are: Week Date Section Topic Online Session 1 11/01/2021 Foundational Concepts Geocomputation: An Introduction N/A 2 18/01/2021 Foundational Concepts GIScience and GIS software Seminar 3 25/01/2021 Foundational Concepts Cartography and Visualisation I Help/Study Groups 4 01/02/2021 Foundational Concepts Programming (for Statistical Analysis) Seminar 5 08/02/2021 Foundational Concepts Programming for Spatial Analysis &amp; ESDA Help/Study Groups READING WEEK READING WEEK READING WEEK CODING CHALLENGE - - 6 16/11/2021 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns I: Spatial Auto-Correlation &amp; Regression Seminar 7 23/11/2021 Core Spatial Analysis Analysing Spatial Patterns II: Clusters Help/Study Groups 8 30/11/2021 Core Spatial Analysis Rasters, Zonal Statistics and Interpolation Seminar 9 07/12/2021 Advanced Spatial Analysis Geodemographics Help/Study Groups 10 14/12/2021 Cartography &amp; Visualisation Cartography and Visualisation II Seminar The lectures and practicals of this course only form a part of the learning process. You are expected to undertake wider reading (see the Reading List below), particularly to help with your second assessment. In addition to our course, there are many other online resources and tutorials that can help expand on the topics and content we cover - whilst it is not necessary for your assessments, you are encouraged to go beyond our recommendations and fully engage with applied GIS research, methods and visualisation techniques. Following certain ‘movers and shakers’ in the GIScience / Spatial Data Science world is one approach to learn more about what’s happening in the field and might prove inspirational for your dissertation ideas later this year. Reading List We link to books and resources throughout each practical. The full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course. Alternatively, you can always easily find the link to the Reading List in the top right of any Moodle page for our module, under “Library Resources”. This Reading List will be updated on a weekly basis, in preparation for the week to come, so you may see some weeks without reading for now. But please check back at the start of each week as the lecture, seminar and/or workshop material is released for that week to check for new readings. All reading for that week will be provided by the time your learning materials are released - so you will not need to check the reading list for updates as the week progresses. Troubleshooting Module Content Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with - particularly when we combine this with learning how to program at the same time. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash, you’ll end up with bugs in your code that are difficult to find, and you may spend a whole day trying to track down a single dataset. But the rewards of learning how to do all of this (particularly with this year’s emphasis on this online research for your dissertations) will become apparent. To bring in my first of potentially several cycling references, a well-known quote from Tour De France (1986, 1989, 1990) winner Greg Lemond: “It never gets easier, you just go faster.” Resonates quite well with spatial analysis and programming! Even after years of programming, we can still forget the syntax to a for loop or question what kernel density estimation actually shows, but you will - by the end of the next ten weeks - know how to find out the answers to these problems faster! Beyond the help sessions mentioned above, if you need specific assistance with this course please: Attend the fortnightly GIS/coding help sessions (from Week 3) to ask questions directly to Jakub or Nikki. Post in the respective tech-help or r-help channels within the Geocomputation Team. Ask a question at the end of a seminar (time-permitting) Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to the assessment (more information will be provided in Week 5) Attend the Coding Therapy sessions that are run on a weekly basis Due to the size of the class we will only reply to tech and R help messages on Teams so all students can see the discussion. If you have a personal matter in relation to completing the course then please speak to or email Jo. We’d also encourage you to monitor the tech-help or r-help channels and contribute to/answer questions as/if you can! Creating a small community across our course will help all of us in the long-run. If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help, you can book into our office hours. These meetings are to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module. Additional Online Help &amp; Resources We are here to help you work through these practicals but even we do not know everything. Therefore, it’s a good idea to become familar with online sources of help, such as: Stack Exchange RStudio community QGIS documemtation R documentation ArcGIS help pages Ultimately, if you are struggling to use R don’t worry…here is some advice from a tweet and interview with Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at RStudio… You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally — Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) 11. Februar 2015 It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. We highly advocate taking a break if you get stuck - the Workbook will not disappear, and you can complete the content at your own pace! Expanding your R learning (to infinity and beyond!) In addition to our course, there are many online tutorials that can help with learning R, specifically: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R Feedback: Weekly and End of Module We can only make this course better through your feedback. We collect feedback: At the end of every practical. There is a link to an anonymous feedback form, please let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session. At the end of the module. The standard UCL feedback form will be available to fill in on Moodle. Acknowledgements Part of this page is adapted from CASA0005. "],["what-is-this-workbook.html", "What is this Workbook? Using this Workbook Workbook Functionality", " What is this Workbook? All course content, including lectures and practical material, will be contained within this Workbook (hence it’s name!). As outlined earlier, you will also need to be part of our Geocomputation Team to have access to the lectures within the workbook. Any official course requirements (e.g. submission links for assessments) will be on Moodle. Each week’s content will be uploaded to the Workbook for Tuesday 10am UK time after the third seminar or coding help sessions. Using this Workbook Alongisde the recorded lectures and practical instructions, key things to look out for in the Workbook are Assignments, which are short optional submissions, Key Reading(s) and Points of Information, including Learning Objectives, Tips and Recap. To help, we’ll try to highlight them as follows: Assignment Each week, you’ll have 1-3 short assignments where we would like you to submit either a response, map or code prior to our seminar session or have it ready to present during the session itself. Key Reading(s) The recommended readings for this week will be highlighted in a Reading Box as and when appropriate in the week’s content. You’ll be able to find direct links to them within the E-Reading list. Learning Objectives Each week, we’ll start with a highlight of the learning objectives we hope you’ll achieve through the practical and lecture content. Get Ahead Tips Tips for effective note-taking during the practicals such as recording the functions you end up using in our practicals and your understanding of the arguments that they require. Recap A recap at the end of each section or week - make sure you take a note of these and are confident that you understand the points addressed.

Acknowledgements Part of this page is adapted from CASA0005. "],["software-installation.html", "Software Installation QGIS R and R-Studio ArcGIS Installation Issues", " Software Installation This course primarily uses the R data science programming language and we strongly advise you complete the assignment using it. We briefly touch upon QGIS in the first few weeks to give you a basic foundation in spatial analysis alongside the range of spatial software available. Please follow the instructions below before completing the first practical session (in Week 2) to install the software on your local computer. Alternatively, both software are available on UCL’s computers and therefore can be accessed through Desktop Anywhere - however depending on your internet connection, this may be slow to use and, as a result, a highly frustrating experience! As outlined below, we have an online version of R-Studio available for use, but as yet, we do not have one for Q-GIS. If you are unable to download Q-GIS for your own computer, please let us know through the form below. QGIS QGIS is an open-source graphic user interface GIS with many community developed add-on packages (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. To get QGIS on your personal machine go to: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html We recommend installing the OSGeo4W version. The nature of open-source means that several programs will rely on each other for features. OSGeo4W tracks all the shared requirements and does not install any duplicates. R and R-Studio R is both a programming language and software environment - in the form of R-Studio- originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. R’s great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system and free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical and importantly for us, geographical tasks. R-Studio Setup 1 Search for and open RStudio. You can install R Studio on your own machine from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download R studio requires R which you can download from: https://cran.rstudio.com/ RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R — it makes R much easier to use. If you are using a Mac and run into issues, firstly follow the instructions below then check out the [Mac R issues] section if the problem persists. R-Studio Setup 2 UCL students (and staff) can now also make use of R Studio Server. It’s RStudio on a webpage, so no installation is required. Access information will be provided on Moodle in Week 2. ArcGIS ArcGIS Pro (previously ArcMap) is the main commercial GIS software that you may have already used - or seen/heard about through other modules or even job aderts. We do not use ArcGIS Pro in our Practicals for several reasons: Computing requirements for ArcGIS Pro are substantial and it only operates on the Windows Operating System. For Mac users, using ArcGIS Pro (and ArcMap) would require using iether a Virtual Machine or “splitting your own harddrive” to install a Windows OS. It is proprietary software, which means you need a license to use the software. For those of us in education, the University covers the cost of this license, but when you leave, you will need to pay for a personal license (around £100!) to continue using the software and repeat any analysis you’ve used the software for. Whilst ArcPro can use pure Python (and even R) as a programming language within it through scripts and notebooks, it primarily relies on its own ArcPy and ArcGIS API for Python packages to run the in-built tools and analytical functions. To use these packages, you still need a license which makes it difficult to share your code with others if they do not have their own ArcGIS license. Recent developments in the ArcPro software however does make it an attractive tool for spatial data science - it has cross-user functionality, from data analysts who like to use a tool called Notebooks for their code development, to those focused more on cartography and visualisation with in-built bridges to Adobe’s Creative Suite. We therefore do not want to put you off looking into ArcGIS in the future, but for this course, we want to ensure the reproducibility of work (you’ll learn more about this in Week 1’s lectures). **Therefore, the analysis for your coursework must be completed in R/R-Studio and QGIS (where permissible, see guidance in Week 5). Installation Issues If you have any issues with installing either Q-GIS or R, please let us know during Week 1 via the tech-help channel within the Geocomputation Team. PLEASE CONFIRM YOU SOFTWARE INSTALLATION We would appreciate it if you can fill in this Installation Confirmation Form to confirm whether you have been able to install the relevant software by Friday 15th January 2021 5pm UK time.
