Geocomputation is assessed through two separate Assessments:

1) **Social Atlas:** The first assessment will involve the completion of a spatial analysis project, based on the theory, concepts and application learnt during the module. For this coursework you are required to create a small “social atlas” on a topic or area that interests you.

2) **Exam:** The second assessment will take the form of an Exam, the exact format to be confirmed.
