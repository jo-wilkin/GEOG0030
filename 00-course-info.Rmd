## Self guided learning {-}

The lectures and practicals of this course only form a part of the learning process. You are expected to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with applied GIS research, methods and visualisation techniques.

If you find a practical particularly easy or straightforward then please move on to the next one. Practicals that look at analytical relationships also have extension activities for you to try.

## Online Help & Resources  {-}

Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash. The academic staff are here to help you work through these practicals but we do not know everything. It's a good idea to become familar with online sources of help, such as:

* [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/)
* [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
* [QGIS documemtation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/index.html)
* [R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/)
* [ArcGIS help pages](https://support.esri.com/en)



## Reading list {-}

We link to books and resources throughout each practical. The [full reading list for the course](https://rl.talis.com/3/ucl/lists/3FB0C66A-F603-A402-A31C-28F2DA091AB6.html?lang=en-gb&login=1) is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course. Alternatively, you can always easily find the link to the Reading List in the top right of any Moodle page for our module, under "Library Resources". 

This Reading List will be updated on a weekly basis, in preparation for the week to come, so you may see some weeks without reading for now. But please check back at the **start of each week** as the lecture, seminar and/or workshop material is released for that week to check for new readings. All reading for that week will be provided by the time your learning materials are released - so you will not need to check the reading list for updates as the week progresses.

## More help {-}

If you need specific assistance with this course please:

* Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to assignments / deadlines. There is also an expected assignment timeline and frequently asked questions section within the assessment outline document.

* Speak to a member of the teaching team in the computer lab sessions

* Ask a question at the end of a lecture (time permitting)

* Ask a question on slack under the GIS channel--- you should have recevied an invite email from Steve Gray otherwise use [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/casastudents2019-2020/signup). The teaching team will monitor this --- use the #gis channel for this course.

Due to the size of the class we will **only reply** to messages **on slack** so all students can see the discussion. If you have a personal matter in relation to completing the course then please speak to or email Andy or Adam.

If you are struggling to use R don't worry...here is some advice from a tweet and  [interview](https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/) with Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at RStudio...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You&#39;re doing it right if you get frustrated: if you&#39;re not frustrated, you&#39;re (probably) not stretching yourself mentally</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/565516733516349441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">11.

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

You can also go through other free resources including: 

* [Free RStudio Education resources](https://education.rstudio.com)

* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r)

* [YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)

At the end of every practical there is a link anonymous Google feeback form, let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session.

If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help you can book into our office hours. These meetings are **to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module**.
